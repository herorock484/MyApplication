                The Development Team should have all the skills needed to: ...
                Do all of the development work, but not the types of testing that require specialized testing,
                tools, and environments. Turn the Product Backlog items it selects into an increment of
                potentially shippable product functionality. a real developer has adequate skills required
                to attain a company activities. a developer should be ready to learn new modes of codding
                and development rather than being static to his own ways. most developers in kenya have great
                skills that can help them have exposure to international and professional aspects of
                development

                kenyan universities should do some changes in their styles and modes of training.This is a main challenge that make them not to perfect on their areas of programming and coding world. They are only focused in theoretical part of programming instead of the practical part of it, this sounds like a waste of time as they seem to have gained so much little knowledge at the end of their study period in the university level of learning.

                Most genius developers are said to have come from india.
                this has been the ideology of many people for quite a long time.
                this has of recent been depicted, and wee are proud that in kenya there are so other
                developers as well, which are capable of doing great projects as well. though some developers
                might have failed in one way or another in their field of development, this does not mean that
                all developers are worst.according to a Research that was conducted to some developers it was found
                that the idea of a developer skill is determined by his ability to produce a perfect code . This can
                lead to a developer failing a company project or promoting it to a great deal in the world of
                programming.Mr.Alex from University of Nairobi argued that the more the practice,the  perfect the
                programmer. this should not be the case any more. from the skills i have learnt from i-we limited
                company with other two placements, we are going to be the

                for you to become a developer, you should take computer science course in a university.
                that is the assummption of many people in kenya. this is not real. its a lie. you c an become
                a professional developer even if you dont make it to university level of education, what you only
                need is focus and passion in the computing and codding world. you only need to have habit of
                coding, sitting for long hours while codng and read articles of coding such as laracasts videos.
                this will give you enough knowledge of coding and as far as programming is concerned.
                you will require a professional person to take you through
                your course of studies, teach you how to arrange your work as well.
