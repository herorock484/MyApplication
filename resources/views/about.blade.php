                         I took interest in computer technology while i was in class two.by then, i could just play around with gadgets like mobile phones, trying to figure out how they works. i could dismantle them at any instance of time,searching for the people who speak through it , whether the people are mounted inside them or not.to a amatter of fact,i realized that mobile phonesa just uses a simple technology of waves and frequency intensity, which is the answer i got from my class two teacher by then. this drove more crazy to dive in for more knowledde on how this is possible, of how a communication is created between people in different areas and region using a wireless connection as well.the same applies to radio communication as well.broadcasters could be heard speaking but they are not in the device so called Radio. i had to dig more in computer technology to see how things works out in the computer world as well. should i stop? definately not, i had to get more in it. funny enough, in my secondary level of education, i did not take computer science lesson. i diverged into business instead, to get san nderstanding in the theory of business manangement and application of skills in the business world as well. this took me well and i noticed how computer skills are related to business. ooh my goodness, skills in computers science could also be converted into business. a brilliant idea, anyway.it al depends with your skills, ambitions and your effort you keep in it anyway. higher level of learning, that is university level made the day. i had now to specialize in computer science, which is driving me to my career.
